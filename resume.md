## Working Experience

#### Gracenote (Machine Learning Engineer, 2024/07 - present) 

* **Enhanced Program Search:**  
  Developed and trained a cross encoder model to boost TV program search match rates, optimizing retrieval accuracy across a vast catalog.

* **NLP Innovation:**  
  Applied advanced NLP techniques to analyze and process TV show metadata, improving content discoverability and user experience.

* **Content Description Enrichment:**  
  Key member in a project to enrich content descriptions using large language models (LLMs). Designing translation and restyling pipelines that adapt text length, tone, and style based on language and regional rules.

* **Agentic AI Implementation:**  
  Integrated agentic AI frameworks and dynamic rule sets to automate and refine content adaptation, ensuring consistent quality and localization across markets.

#### Yardi Systems (Machine Learning Engineer, 2023/09 - 2024/06) 

* **Team Leadership:**  
  Key member of the newly established machine learning team at Yardi Systems.

* **LLM-Powered Chatbot Development:**  
  Primary engineer responsible for developing an LLM-powered chatbot tailored for property management clients.

* **API Framework Creation:**  
  Instrumental in creating the Yardi Virtuoso LLM Chatbot API framework, built on Llama Index with advanced capabilities:
  - Dynamic creation of new tools from OpenAPI specifications.
  - Enabling function calls to API endpoints for enhanced LLM responses.
  - Leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to expand the LLM knowledge base.

* **Chatbot Functionality:**  
  Designed to:
  - Provide information to current and potential tenants.
  - Enable task performance (e.g., scheduling appointments) via a natural language chat interface.
  - Incorporate custom intent functions tailored for client-specific needs, thereby enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

## Projects

* **[From Videos to Actions: Exploiting Video Captioning and a Large Language Model for Sequential Action Identification and Prediction](https://github.com/CommodoreArz/NextStepPredictor)**
  * Final research project for my MS in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara under Dr. Xifeng Yan.
  * Utilized Microsoft Research's SwinBERT model to perform video segment captioning across multiple segments, capturing individual actions.
  * Leveraged Flan-T5 to predict the next likely action based on a series of captions, with training focused on cooking videos using the YouCook2 dataset.
  * Designed to function as a "copilot" to assist users in various tasks such as cooking, assembling furniture, or performing machinery maintenance.

## Publications

* **[Playing Pokemon Red With Reinforcement Learning](https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/concern/theses/vq27zt01j?locale=en)**
  * Presented at the first annual CSCSU Undergraduate Conference.
  * Developed as a capstone project in collaboration with Elizabeth Flaherty and Aaron Jimenez, under the advisement of Dr. Bahareh Abbasi.
  * Employed Machine Learning techniques to train an agent to play Pokémon Red, using TensorFlow, Stable Baselines, and OpenAI's Gym-Retro.
  * [Code Hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/eflaherty2556/Pokemon-Red-AI): “Playing Pokémon Red with Reinforcement Learning – Do Pokémon Dream of Electric Mareep?”
